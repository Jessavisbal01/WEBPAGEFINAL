        <i><ul> 
<li>Verse 1 : <br>
</br>There's somethin' bout the             way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh, yeah
 <br> 
 
 
 </br>
 
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you.</li><br>

<li>Chorus : <br>                
                </br>
            <mark>And I don't know how it gets be etter  than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless</mark></li><br>

<li>Verse 2 : <br>

</br>Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless

Oh, yeah</li>
             
         </ul></i>

<i><li>Chorus : <br>

    </br>'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless
Oh, oh, oh yeah
